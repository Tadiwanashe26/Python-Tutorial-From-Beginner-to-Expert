    "Python is not a statically typed programming language unlike what we have in some languages such as C, TypeScript etc. This simply means that you dont have to delcare the type of the variable you want to use before declaring it. All you need to do is just declare it and python determines its type. Beautiful right? While this is awesome it also comes with its won disadvantages. Let's not go into that now. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to understand Python data types, i will like to classify them acccording to the types. They are seven types with several data types that depends on the type of data we are dealing with. \n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "Text: \t\t`str` - Strings\n",
    "Numbers: \t`int` - Integers, `float` - Floating Numbers, `complex` - Complex Numbers\n",

    "Mapping:\t`dict` - dictionary\n",

    "## Text\n",
    "### `String`\n",
    "This is a sequence of unicode characters that can be represented with either single quote `'` or double quote `\"`. This simply means that any string that wrirtten in python is wrapped inside a quote. Python is not hard on the rule of using either single quote or double quote, so please feel free to use anyone you so wish. Examples of a string and how to initialize them. \n",

    "Sometimes you can see a number declared and initialized with quotes such as `age = 26` it simply means that the number wants to be seen as a string. More details about strings will come in the string section. \n",
    "\n",
    "##  Numbers\n",
    "### `int` - Integers \n",
    "Integer numbers can be positive, negative or zero numbers that has no decimal or fractional part. This is just like counting numbers but in this case you can count zero and negatives. examples include \n",
