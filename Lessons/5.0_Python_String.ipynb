    "A string is a collection of characters, while a charcter is regarded as a symbol that may or mayot have relative meaning. Example we have the Arabish character, English Character etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are alot of other technical jargons in between from the encondings  (unicode) and ASCII. \n",

    "## Initialization of String in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very simple to know if a varaibale is a string in python. All variables that appear within a quote either single quote `''` or double quote `\"\"` are assumed to be a string. \n",

    "2. Can you observe that the last three example, have different indentation from the first three (i.e there is no space before the `=` or after it)? White space is not necessary while declaring a variable, we just add white space to make our code beautiful and readable. \n",

If we have a string example `love` that has four characters, therefore when you start counting it you will get four, however most programming languages starts counting or call it indexing from `0`.
