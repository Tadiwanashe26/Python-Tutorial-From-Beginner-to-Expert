    "Syntax in programming is the process of writing a program to accomplish a specific task. It is the set of rules that define the structure of a program. The rules are written in a language called a programming language. The language is the programming language that the program is written in.  The programming language is the set of rules that define the structure of a program. \n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that every programming language has its own set of syntax. Python is therefore no exception to that. Syntax defines the way we give space, the way we comment, the way we put comma etc. This can be both grammatical and structural syntax. "

    "1. Identifiers can contain the 26 alphabet from a -z either lowercase or upper case. It can contain numbers from 0-9 and it can contain underscore (`_`). These things can be written in any mixture for example includes: `myName` `myname` `myNAME` `my_name`\n",
