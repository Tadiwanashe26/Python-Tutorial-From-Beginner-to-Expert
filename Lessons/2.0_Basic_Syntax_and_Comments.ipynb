    "Syntax in programming is the process of writing a program to accomplish a specific task. It is the set of rules that define the structure of a program. The rules are written in a language called a programming language. The language is the programming language that the program is written in.  The programming language is the set of rules that define the structure of a program. \n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that every programming language has its own set of syntax. Python is therefore no exception to that. Syntax defines the way we give space, the way we comment, the way we put comma etc. This can be both grammatical and structural syntax. "

    "Let's start with some motivations. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are possibly here because you either want to learn python or doing a python refresher. If any of those is your reason, then you need no motivation as to why to learn python, you already have all the motivation you need. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if it helps i would want to tell you that python programming language is one of the most popular programming language in the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "## some major uses of python \n",
    "\n",
    " - Web Development \n",
    " - Software Development \n",
    " - Data Science\n",
    " - System Scripting etc. \n",
    " - \n",
    "With these you can see that python can be used for virtually everything. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Reasons why you should learn Python\n",
    "1. Python can be bused for a variety of purpose. \n",
    "2. Python is easy to learn \n",
    "3. Python syntax allows developers write code with fewer lines\n",
    "4. Python is interpreted, meaning that it can be compiled almost immediately at runtime. \n",
    "5. Python is beginner friendly. \n",
    "\n",
    "This and several other reasons are why i think you should learn and stick with python. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Features of Python\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. It can serve multiple purpose such as scripting. \n",
    " 2. It is Object oriented (you will find out more soon)\n",
    " 3. It is good with data, this is why it is used within the data science space. \n",
    " 4. It has a very large community support\n",
    " 5. It can be integrated with alot of programming languge including C, C# etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has lots of features but let me not bore you. I think its best we start coding things out. \n",
    "\n",
    "To prove how easy and simple python is, let us write our first python program. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to print \"Hello World\" to the console. \n",

    "    print(\"Hello, World\")\n",
