    "## Initial Step\n",
    "### For windows: \n",
    "<!-- ToDo Make video on this -->\n",
    "Step 1: Hit the windows search button and type `cmd`. This will open up the command prompt. \n",
    "Step 2: type `python` and hit enter. \n",
    "If your response looks that the picture below, that means that python is already installed in your system, else go to https://www.python.org/ to download and install python for free. \n",
    "\n",
    "### For Mac\n",
    "Step 1: Open the Mac terminal\n",
    "Step 2: type `python` and hit enter. \n",
    "If your response looks that the picture below, that means that python is already installed in your system, else go to https://www.python.org/ to download and install python for free. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is just the first step towards writing our python code. Although you can write python using your command line, but that will be the most boroing thing you will ever do. In the next step \n",
    "\n",
    "## Option 1 (Visual Studio Code)\n",
    "<!-- ToDo Make video on this -->\n",
    "Step 1: Download and install  Visual Studio Code @ https://code.visualstudio.com/\n",
    "Step 2: Install the following extensions: \n",
    "\ta. Python extension by Microsoft it offers (IntelliSense (Pylance), Linting, Debugging (multi-threaded, remote), Jupyter Notebooks, code formatting, refactoring, unit tests, and more)\n",
    "\tb. Jupyter notebook by Microsoft for (support, interactive programming and computing that supports Intellisense, debugging and more.)\n",

    " - https://replit.com/languages/python3\n",
    "And several other online IDE. You should be careful of some online IDE, they might throw up error in a perfectly working environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Option 3 (Online Code Editor + IDE) \n",
    "<!-- ToDo Make video on this -->\n",
    "This is just like having your visual studio code in the browser. Some of these tools are so powerful and easy to use. You can also get alot of compute time free of charge. \n",
    "\n",
    "The one i have used is https://www.gitpod.io/. They are others, but this is the one i feel more comfortable using. Feel freee to explore. \n",
