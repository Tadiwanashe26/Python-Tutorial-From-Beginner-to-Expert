## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èWhy you should learn python

Here i wanted to start giving you motivation on why you should learn python üôÇ. However, i decided against it, because for you to be here you are already aware of the **Power of Python** so i dont need to talk and demostrate much. For the sake of completeness, i will leave you with some few thoughs and encouragement.

According to Statista.com python ranks 3rd most used prigramming language nehind javascript and HTML, and ahead of Java. This proves that the lnaguage has gotten even more popular.

The popularity also comes in its usage. Python can be used in a wide range of things which includes:

- AI & Machine Learning
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualisation
- Programming Applications
- Web development etc.
It has wide range of applications. This is made possible by the various modules and packages (I will explain modules and packages below) available in python.
